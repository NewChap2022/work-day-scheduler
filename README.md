Implement a simple calendar app for scheduling one work day.

## Criteria
- [x] The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- [x] Time blocks for standard business hours is displayed
- [x] Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- [x] When click into a time block, user can enter an event
- [x] When click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage
- [x] WHEN refresh the page, the saved events persist

html, css(bootstrap), javascript(jquery)

## Reflection
To make one function work, for me the best way is to write down what you plan to do in plain words and consider all possible issue or bugs may arise. It helps me and makes coding easier. "console.log" is really helpful along the way to detect problem earlier.
